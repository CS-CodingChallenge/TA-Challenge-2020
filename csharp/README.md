# C# skeleton

This folder contains everything necessary for completing the TA Coding Challenge in Python.

The contents of the folder will need to copied and pasted into your skeleton repositories at the root directory in order for submissions to be valid. Please ensure that you also include the .travis.yml file, which is needed to evaluate your solutions.

To run tests locally, simply run all tests using your favoured IDE. Please note that this won't produce a green or red build - test results will be printed out to your console.

## PLEASE NOTE: Once you have copied and pasted the files, please ONLY edit files in C_Sharp_Skeleton_2019/Answers/. If you wish to edit any other files, ensure you get prior permission.

Good luck!
